- APIs are programming features for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or manipulating data from other web sites or services.
introduction to web APIs
- APIs in client-side JavaScript: browser APIs and third-party APIs
- the key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". when calling a method from a library, the developer is in control. with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls the developer's code.
- common browser APIs:
	- APIs for manipulating documents (DOM API)
	- APIs that fetch data from the server (Fetch API)
	- APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics (Canvas, WebGL)
	- Audio and Video APIs (HTMLMediaElement, Web Audio API, WebRTC)
	- Device APIs (Geolocation API)
	- Client-side storage APIs (Web Storage API, IndexedDB API)
- common third-party APIs
	- Twitter API
	- Mapquest, Google Maps API
	- Facebook suite of APIs
	- Telegram APIs
	- Youtube, Pinterest, Twilio, Mastodon API
- play() and pause() methods being used to play and pause the track are not part of the Web Audio API; they are part of the HTMLMediaElement API, which is different but closely-related.
